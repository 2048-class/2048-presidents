You can [fork the original repo as well](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n2048 is licensed under the [MIT license.](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\nGabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.\r\n",
